# Portfolio Blueprint

## Goals
- Present a concise hero landing that introduces Tharindu Silva and routes visitors to detailed sections.
- Provide a resume page that mirrors a traditional CV while staying easy to read on the web.
- Keep navigation simple with room to expand for projects, contact forms, and case studies.

## Site Map
1. `/` – Home hero: name, role, quick introduction, call-to-actions for resume and contact.
2. `/resume` – Curriculum vitae: experience timeline, education, skills, credentials.
3. Future expansions
   - `/projects` – Selected case studies with visuals and impact summaries.
   - `/contact` – Direct contact form and social links.
   - `/about` – Longer-form story, values, and spotlight photo gallery.

## Content Structure
- **Global Header (future):** Sticky navigation linking to all major sections/pages.
- **Home Hero:** Portrait (or stylized initials), tagline, short elevator pitch, CTA buttons.
- **Experience Snapshot (home):** 2–3 highlighted roles with achievements (cards or timeline).
- **Featured Projects:** Carousel or grid highlighting outcomes, tech stack, and links.
- **Testimonials (optional):** Quotes from colleagues or clients for credibility.
- **Contact Strip:** Email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub prominently placed.

## Resume Page Layout
1. **Header:** Name, contact info, quick summary statement.
2. **Experience:** Reverse-chronological timeline with company, role, impact statements.
3. **Education & Certifications:** Degrees, key modules, certificates.
4. **Skills:** Grouped by languages, frameworks, cloud, tooling.
5. **Extras (optional):** Awards, publications, volunteering.

## Visual Direction
- Dark hero with soft gradients, contrasting light content panels.
- Rounded cards with subtle shadows to convey depth.
- Accent color derived from brand preference (to be decided) for CTAs and headings.
- Consistent typography using Geist sans/mono pairing provided by Next.js.

## Next Steps
1. Gather brand assets: final portrait, logo/mark, color palette.
2. Draft detailed copy for hero, about, projects, and resume sections.
3. Implement responsive layouts and navigation.
4. Integrate analytics/contact form as needed.
5. Add deployment automation (CI/CD) for GitHub Pages or Vercel.
